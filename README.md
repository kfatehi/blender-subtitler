# blender-subtitler

super simple subtitle script for blender (last used on blender v2.78)

reads text file containing a very simple format for subtitles, example:

```
82-161 Hi, how are you?
298-332 I'm good, it's my birthday today.
516-560 Great I'm happy to hear that!
```

the script will create text strips for each of these
